**** **What is Logistic Regression?**
`Prerequisite:`
* **Regression:** Regression is the process that descrives the relationship between one or more independent_variable and a dependent_variable. For Example- mid : final, smoking/drinking : probability_of_heart_attack, previous_purchase_history : predict_purchasing_or_not
* Regression usually works on numerical values
* Types of Regression: i. Linear (Simple, Multiple), ii. Logistic iii. Polynomial
* `Simple Regression`: one_independent : one_dependent. Example- mid : final
* `Multiple Regression`: two_or_more_independent : one_dependent. Example: attendance/class_test/mid : final
* *Linear Regression best fitted when the relationship is more likely linear
* `Logistic Regression`:
* `Polynimial Regression`: one_or_more_independent : one_dependent. Example- good_at_programming : marks [* more likely suitable for non-linear relationship]
> **Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression describes the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary dependent variable. Example: smoking : heart_attack or age/smoking/drinking/salary/marital_status : probability_of_heart_attack.
